Parameter,Value,Rationale
τ_gap,0.05–0.30 m,"Looser at long range, tighter near"
s (unit scale),1e−3 (mm→m),ChArUco sizes in mm
Undistort anchors,Yes,Reduces model bias at wide FOV
Confidence θ (fire),0.50,Suppress low-quality triangulations
Confidence θ (smoke),0.60,Smoke harder → stricter gate
q_min (AnchorNet),0.30,Filter unreliable anchors
