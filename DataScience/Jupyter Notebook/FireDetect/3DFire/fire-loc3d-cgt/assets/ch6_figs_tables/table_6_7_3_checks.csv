Check,Symptom,Action
Parallel rays,1−(d1·d2)^2 ≈ 0,Reject stereo; fallback to plane
Huge gap (g>τ_gap),Inconsistent geometry / mismatch,Reject stereo; fallback to plane
Ray ‖ plane (n·d≈0),No stable floor intersection,Defer or clamp; wait next frame
Out-of-volume,X̂ outside operating box,Discard; keep last stable estimate
Low anchor quality,Unstable or off-center anchors,Skip or downweight in fusion
