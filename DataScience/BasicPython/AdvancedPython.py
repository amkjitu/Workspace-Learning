###important packages for data analysis

##two dimensional arrays and row column operations
#numpy
#pandas

##scientific calculations and equations
#scipy
#statsmodels.api

#Data visualization
#Data visualization takes an important place in image processing. 
#Data can be a single 2D grayscale image or a more complex one with multidimensional aspects: 3D in space, timelapse, multiple channels.
#Therefore, the visualization strategy will depend on the data complexity and a range of tools external 
#to scikit-image can be used for this purpose. Historically, scikit-image provided viewer tools but powerful packages are now 
#available and must be preferred.

#Matplotlib
#Matplotlib is a library able to generate static plots, which includes image visualization.
#seaborn

#Plotly
#Plotly is a plotting library relying on web technologies with interaction capabilities.

#Mayavi
#Mayavi can be used to visualize 3D images.

#Napari
#Napari is a multi-dimensional image viewer. It’s designed for browsing, annotating, and analyzing large multi-dimensional images.


##what is in statsmodels also in scikit learn but in large version
#sklearn
